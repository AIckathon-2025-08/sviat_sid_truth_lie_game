## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Models & Relationships
```ruby
class Game < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :statements, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :votes, dependent: :destroy
  
  def total_votes
    votes.count
  end
  
  def percentage_votes(statement_id)
    return 0 if total_votes == 0
    (statement_votes(statement_id).to_f / total_votes * 100).round(1)
  end
end
```

### Controller Logic
```ruby
def vote
  employee_name = params[:employee_name].strip
  
  if Vote.employee_has_voted?(@game.id, employee_name)
    redirect_to @game, alert: 'You have already voted in this game.'
    return
  end
  
  statement = @game.statements.find(params[:statement_id])
  @game.votes.create!(
    statement: statement,
    employee_name: employee_name,
    voted_at: Time.current
  )
  
  session[:employee_name] = employee_name
  redirect_to results_game_path(@game), notice: 'Vote recorded successfully!'
end
```
